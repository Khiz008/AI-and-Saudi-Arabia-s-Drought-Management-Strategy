SDG 13
SDG 13: Climate Action
Overview
SDG 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, affecting every country and region. It is causing more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to food and water supply, with devastating consequences for people and ecosystems.

Targets
SDG 13 has 5 targets:

Strengthen Resilience to Climate Hazards (Target 13.1):

Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.
Integrate Climate Change Measures into Policies and Planning (Target 13.2):

Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.
Improve Education and Awareness on Climate Change (Target 13.3):

Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.
Climate Finance for Developing Countries (Target 13.a):

Implement the commitment by developed countries to jointly mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful climate action.
Capacity Building for Least Developed Countries (Target 13.b):

Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing states.
Challenges
Global Emissions: Despite progress, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, contributing to worsening climate impacts.
Adaptation Funding: Many developing countries lack the financial resources needed for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.
Policy Implementation: Translating climate commitments into concrete policies and actions at the national and local levels remains a challenge.
Importance
Climate action is critical for protecting ecosystems, safeguarding human health, and ensuring the resilience of communities to climate-related disasters. Addressing climate change is also essential for achieving other SDGs, such as poverty reduction, health, and food security.

Climate records were shattered in 2023, with the world watching the climate crisis unfold in real time. Communities around the world are suffering the effects of extreme weather, which is destroying lives and livelihoods on a daily basis. The roadmap to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C and avoid the worst of climate chaos cannot afford any delays, indecision or half measures by the global community. It demands immediate action for drastic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions in this decade and the achievement of net zero by 2050.

Target 13.1: o The number of disaster-related deaths and missing persons per 100,000 population (excluding COVID-19 deaths) has nearly halved from 1.62 in the decade 2005-2014 to 0.82 in 2013-2022. However, the absolute number remains high. Between 2013 and 2022, disasters worldwide claimed 42,553 mortalities each year. Further, the number of persons affected by disasters per 100,000 population has increased by over two-third, from 1,169 in 2005-2014 to 1,980 in 2013-2022. 

o In 2023, 129 countries reported the adoption and implementation of national disaster risk reduction strategies, increasing from 55 countries in 2015. Among these countries, 122 countries have reported promoting policy coherence and compliance with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement as a key element in the strategy.

Target 13.2: The year 2023 broke every single climate indicator and was the warmest year on record according to the World Meteorological Organization. Global temperatures rose to 1.45°C, dangerously close for the first time to the 1.5°C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Despite some reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, concentrations of greenhouse gases reached record high observed levels in 2022 and real-time data in 2023 show greenhouse gases continuing to increase. Carbon dioxide levels are 150% above pre-industrial levels.

Target 13.3: A study in 2023 of more than 530 grade 9 science and social science subject curricula found that 69% contained no reference to climate change and 66% made no mention of sustainability. However, three-quarters of countries reported they have plans to revise their curricula in the next three years to focus more on climate change and sustainability.

Target 13.a: Climate finance, reported by Annex I Parties as support provided to developing countries, has increased at a compound rate of 5% from 2015 to 2020, amounting to $41 billion. Although there are a range of estimates and a lack of an agreed accounting methodology on the $100 billion per year goal, the goal was not yet met as of 2021. However, recent progress made in the provision and mobilization of climate finance amounted to $89.6 billion in 2021.
