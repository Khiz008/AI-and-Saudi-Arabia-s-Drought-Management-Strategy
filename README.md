# AI-and-Saudi-Arabia-s-Drought-Management-Strategy
This project investigates Saudi Arabia's approach to addressing water scarcity by analyzing its national policies—Mission 2030, National Innovation Plan, and National Water Management Strategy 2030—in comparison with international standards such as the Paris Agreement, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, and select Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using Python tools for content analysis, the study examines thematic overlaps and synergies between Saudi policies and global frameworks, identifying areas of alignment and gaps. Findings indicate strong coherence between Mission 2030 and international drought management standards, while the National Water Strategy aligns more selectively, primarily with SDG 6 and the UN Convention. This research highlights Saudi Arabia's commitment to integrating international drought and water management goals while suggesting that broader data and full-text analysis could enhance insights into policy alignment and effectiveness.
